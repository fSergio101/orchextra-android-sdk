![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-Android-brightgreen.svg)
![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-2.0.0-blue.svg)


A library that gives you access to Orchextra platform from your Android app.

## Getting started
Start by creating a project in [Orchextra dashboard][dashboard], if you haven't done it yet. Go to "Setting" > "SDK Configuration" to get the **api key** and **api secret**, you will need these values to start Orchextra SDK.

## Overview
Orchextra SDK is composed of **Orchextra Core**.  
#### Orchextra Core
- Geofences
- Beacons

## Installation
Download [Orchextra Android Sample ](https://github.com/Orchextra/orchextra-android-sample-app) to understand how to use the SDK.

### Requirements
Android Jelly Bean (v. 18) or later. But Orchextra can be integrated in Android Gingerbread (v. 10)

## Add the dependencies
We have to add the gradle dependencies. In our **build.gradle** file, we add the next maven dependency; 

```java
allprojects {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
}
```
and we add the Orchextra dependency in our app module like this:
```java
    compile 'com.github.Orchextra.orchextra-android-sdk:orchextrasdk:2.0.0'
```
and we must sync gradle project.

## Integrate Orchextra SDK
We have to created a class which extends from Application (if we didn't do yet) and add the Orchextra init method. We could implement OrchextraCompletionCallback interface in order to receive the orchextra status.   

```java
Orchextra.init(this, new OrchextraCompletionCallback() {              
                    @Override
                    public void onSuccess() {
                        GGGLogImpl.log("onSuccess");
                    }              
                   @Override
                    public void onError(String s) {
                        GGGLogImpl.log("onError: " + s);
                    }
                    @Override
                    public void onInit(String s) {
                        GGGLogImpl.log("onInit: " + s);
                    }
                });
```
Then, in any part of our application we should start the orchextra sdk
```java
Orchextra.start("f7ae1c1bb7a556fdc9b517706d6f7a0c041334d9", "1a9e4aeadc38b3234b0cd119279ddfb1d9bf7f28");
```

## Custom Scheme - Delegate
In order to get custom schemes within our app must conform the CustomSchemeReceiver interface, the following method will handle all the custom schemes created in Orchextra.

```java
Orchextra.setCustomSchemeReceiver(new CustomSchemeReceiver() {
            @Override
            public void onReceive(String scheme) {
                Log.i("TAG", "SCHEME: " + scheme);
            }
        });
```

## Add user to Orchextra
ORCUser class is a local representation of a user persisted to the Orchextra Database to help to create a good user segmentation. This object is optional and could be set up at any time.
```java
Orchextra.setUser(new ORCUser("1234567890",
                new GregorianCalendar(1990, 10, 13),
                ORCUser.Gender.ORCGenderMale,
                new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList("keyword1", "keyword2"))));
```
